AI based Travel Advisory Chatbot
This is our first assignment which is a chatbot for prospective travellers providing all relevant information regarding a specific destination. 







Could you create a simple and user-friendly AI-based bot

site named ”gobybot.com”

, where prospective travellers can find

information regarding different aspects of their trip?
The page will be divided into three vertical sections, namely: left
side, center of the page, and right side, in the proportion of 25%,
50% and 25% respectively.
On the left section of the page, the following links are put under
the heading of ACCOMMODATION as a heading (adjust font size to
fit the page)
• Airbnb.com

• Booking.com
• VRBO.com
• Expedia.com
• Agoda.com
On the right section of the page, the following links are put under
the heading of AIRTICKETS (right side of the page):
• skyscanner.net
• cheaptickets.com
• kayak.com
• moonsand.com
• kiwi.com
• google.com

In the center of the page, I would like to have the following
chat windows
1A separate section where people can put their destination city,
and once a city is determined, the chatbot shows a drop-down
menu where the user can put ticks on desired fields of
information, like.
1 Weather (The weather field provides average temperature

ranges for the duration mentioned).
2 Transport (public and ride-hailing services).
3 Cell Phone SIM Cards.
4 . Visa information (cost and requirements).
5 Vaccination requirements, if any / recommendation.
6 Travel advisory (US and EU).
7 Places to visit (again, drop down 1-7 day itinerary option).
8 Food (restaurants, street food, halal, vegan /non-vegan).
2A separate text window offering the length of stay.
3A separate text window offering a space to mention the budget.
